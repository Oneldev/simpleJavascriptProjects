2. Navigation
The navigation bar provides easy access to different sections of the website. It includes a header with the website name and navigation links.

3. Responsive Design
The website is designed to be responsive, adapting to different screen sizes. This ensures a user-friendly experience on both desktop and mobile devices.

4. Add to Cart
Users can add items to their shopping cart by clicking the "Add to Cart" button on each product card. The quantity is updated on the cart icon.
